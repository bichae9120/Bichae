I emailed the first thing I observed to the ChatGPT side. 
Since then, I have also sent an offer through official routes, but I have now blocked the account after silent and ignoring it with no intention of rejection or withholding it. I just did natural language based structuring as an external user without any illegal activity, is this not illegal?
I specified that if you guys block your account again, you will contact the media, but you blocked my account again?
